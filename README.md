# PCG-html
Freshman project
Named 'Plan comptable Generale' PCG for accounting tool
This is my first dev test ever in computer science field
I created this very simple html/css to initiate webpage as a freshman Academic Grade 1 in 2018

The aim was to buil an apk and use it to replace the usual  physical PCG booknote that costs money.

_ Success:
interface and anchor (link)
content

_ Weakness:
research bar not working yet
single language

#It took me about 35 days to code eniterly manual on Android phone (v4.2 Jellybean) using HTML editor.
